# MyMusicApp

## Description
This is the fourth project of the second phase of Google Developer Challenge Scholarship - Android Basics - 2017/2018, on order to obtain a nanodegree. The subject was to create a structure suitable for a music app, containing 2 to 6 activities. Buttons  allow to switch between activities, opening the corresponding activity with an explicit intent.
I chose to navigate between the ages, each decade is a button. When clicking on each decade, it opens the corresponding list of songs on a new activity. When clicking on a song, a toast message is displayed to say there is no mp3 file available yet. I did it that way for legal property reasons (I did not buy the song files). 

## Technical points
<ul>
  <li>Use of ArrayList to store custom Objects</li>
  <li>Use of Custom Adapter to populate a layout with data</li>
  <li>Use of OnClickLIstener</li>
  <li>Use of explicit Intent </li>
  <li>Use of Arrays to store information, and loops to retrieve it and display it</li>
  <li>Identification of all activities in the  AndroidManifest.xml file</li>
  <li>Generate bitmaps with multiple densities and store them in drawer</li>
  <li>Display a toast message</li>
</ul>
